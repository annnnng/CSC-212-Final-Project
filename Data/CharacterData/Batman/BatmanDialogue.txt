Well hello! So you want to date the Batman, huh? It’s not too hard. What I’m looking for is someone who gets me. Someone willing to dress up and go out on the town. 
No luck? No worries, sweet cheeks! I can give you another hint. This object is only accessible through vanity!
Okay, okay, here’s your last chance! I’m sorry but I cannot give you any more hints. I mean, if you were on Family Feud, this really wouldn’t slide. But, the key to my heart is in the dark!
