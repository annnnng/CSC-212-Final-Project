Bat Shapiro gets down on one knee and presents to you the most beautiful ring. He sweeps you off your feet and you run off into the back end of the Daily Wire Studio to get eloped. You lose all your dignity. I mean, really?? You wanted to marry Bat Shapiro?
Fail
”You’ve got to be kidding me?!? You’d really think that this was the key to my heart?? You must be delusional! A hypocrite!”
