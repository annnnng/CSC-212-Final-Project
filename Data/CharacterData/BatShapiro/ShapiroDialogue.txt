*in a nauseatingly nasal tone* “Well… uh… hello! You… ah, ah, ah… want to be my girlfriend, right? I mean I am handsome, I am perfect, I am the whole package. I am an elite politician with a thirst for drama, so I will always treat you right as long as you ah… ah… make me sandwiches and do your womanly duties.”
