As you turn to face the projector, Professor Nick and Professor Jordan are maniacally pleased to introduce to you the concept of trees and immediately jump into an activity in which you must create a binary decision tree of all the different possibilities of what youâ€™re going to do with your life after college.\nWhile most view this as a short-lived nightmare, you have been reliving this day for the past 3 months. Always starting the same, and ending with you crying into your pillow while the daily mini-lecture plays in the background.");
