## GAME OBJECTIVE

You are placed in a dating simulator. It is your job to traverse through all the different rooms talking to the NPCs and interacting with objects. Each time you talk with a potential suitor, you are trying to figure out which object in the simulation would win them over. You are given 3 rounds of conversation with each suitor and have an obpportunity to offer them an object each round. Be careful, though, because you only have 3 attempts to learn what your desired suitor wants. If on the third try, you still don't offer up the correct object, you will be banished out of the game and must restart the program to try again.
